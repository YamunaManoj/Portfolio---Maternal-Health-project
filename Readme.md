1.Project Goal:
•	Maternal health remains a cornerstone of public healthcare, yet complications during pregnancy and childbirth continue to present significant risks for both mothers and infants worldwide.
•	In this study, 272 pregnant individuals initially participated, but 61 participants (22%) were lost to follow-up, resulting in a final analysis of 211 individuals.
•	Analyzing and observing to predict the risks during pregnancy.

3.Key Findings:  

Gestational Complications: 
Gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and hypertension are among the most commonly reported conditions during pregnancy.
BMI and Blood Pressure serves as a general indicator for gestational complications.
Visceral or preperitoneal fat distribution and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) along with glucose levels play a crucial role in GDM (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus).
Blood pressure and Maternal Fat are key determinants in assessing preeclampsia.
Nutritional Intake have a significant impact on the development and progression GDM and preeclampsia.

Gestational Outcomes:
Gestational age, BMI, fat category, and hypertension are key factors contributing to the likelihood of cesarean delivery
Cesarean sections were performed in 52% of patients with gestational diabetes (GDM).
High visceral fat was observed in 87% of GDM patients.
A history of preeclampsia was reported in 43% of mothers with high fat levels and elevated blood pressure.
High waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was present in 31% of mothers, a factor closely associated with the need for specialized neonatal care.
Substance use significantly impacts pregnancy, with 71% of tobacco users being overweight or obese and 50% of drug users having high blood pressure.

Prescriptive Summary:
Regular assessment of body fat distribution – Monitor visceral and preperitoneal fat levels throughout the trimesters to identify metabolic risks and guide timely maternal health interventions.  
Initiate appropriate medications early – Use safe, condition-specific medications (e.g., insulin for GDM, methyldopa for hypertension) under medical supervision.
Encourage regular physical activity - Promote moderate, pregnancy-safe exercise to improve glucose control and cardiovascular health.
Adopt a balanced, nutrient-rich diet - Ensure intake of essential nutrients (fiber, lean protein, low glycemic index carbs) to maintain metabolic stability.
Monitor key clinical metrics regularly –Track blood pressure, glucose levels, and weight throughout pregnancy for early detection and control.
Support lifestyle modifications – Avoid tobacco, alcohol, and drug use to reduce maternal and fetal complications.
